DigiPres Sandbox
=================

This project makes it possible to play with the tools supported by the [DigiPres Toolbox](https://github.com/digipres/toolbox), running it in the cloud so you can access it via your browser! 

There's a more detailed [introduction to the Sandbox](https://www.digipres.org/workbench/tools/sandbox) on the [DigiPres Workbench](https://github.com/digipres/workbench).

## Starting up your DigiPres Sandbox

The Sandbox works because it takes advantage of [Binder](https://jupyter.org/binder), which was built to support reproducibility in scientific research.  By clicking the button below, you can fire up a remote Linux session with a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) interface, and start experimenting...

**NOTE** please be patient, as it might take a minute or two to before things get started. In particular, the first build of a new version can be very slow and might take a couple of tries. Note also that Binder is an an ephemeral service and your session will be shut down after a while, especially if it's not doing anything. 

Alternatively, you can run the Sandbox on [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), which is a metered service but has a free quota for personal accounts:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/digipres/sandbox)

Once the Codespace is running, you will see this page inside the code editor. You can then get started by [clicking here to open the Welcome notebook](./welcome.ipynb).

## Sample Files

Some test files are included (taken from the [Open Preservation Foundation Format Corpus](https://github.com/openpreserve/format-corpus)). You can also upload your own files using the Jupyter interface.

**NOTE** that while any files you upload to this cloud-hosted service _should_ remain private, this cannot be guaranteed. Do not upload sensitive material!

## Developing The Sandbox

To work on the files in this repository you need Docker and Python 3. You can then install the Binder tools:

```
pip install jupyter-repo2docker
```

And then use the `./build-and-run-here.sh` script which runs this command:

```
jupyter-repo2docker -v .:/home/${USER} .
```

This means the local folder is passed through and you can keep any changes you make to the files.


### Setting the workspace layout

The layout of the workspace, e.g. tabs and notebook arrangements, can be saved and restored as per the example given here: https://github.com/ian-r-rose/binder-workspace-demo/
